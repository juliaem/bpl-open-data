# 6 Analytical Steps
![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

---

# 1. Problem Formulation

+ What question or need am I trying to answer?

+ What’s my organization’s mission and goals?

+ How can I best apply data to this task?

---

# 2. Data Gathering/Preliminary Analysis

+ What data do I think I’m going to need?

+ What condition is it in?

+ Does it tell me what I need?

+ What other data might I need?

+ How much work do I need to put into the data?

---

# 3. Data Cleaning
--

+ Make the data usable and compatible

+ Takes up the most amount of time

+ May require more sophisticated tools depending on the state and size of the data

---

# 4. Hypothesis Testing

+ Am I getting the results I’d hoped for?

+ What other questions come up?
---

# 5. Verification

+ Do my results make sense?

+ Did I make a simple mistake?

+ Check twice and you’ll sleep easier
---

# Spreadsheet Errors Have Consequences

# To Err is Human

> Since 1995, 88% of the 113 spreadsheets audited in 7 studies ... have contained errors.

## - Raymond Panko, "[What We Know About Spreadsheet Errors](http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/My%20Publications/Whatknow.htm)"

---

# 6. Visualization

+ “A picture is worth a thousand words”

+ Communicate results clearly and concisely

+ Help to better understand your data

+ The eyes have a much higher bandwidth into the brain
