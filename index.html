# Case Study: NYC Parking Tickets

???

The Problem: Parking enforcement can be an important source of revenue for city budgets, but
when one fire hydrant generates an annual $25,000 in parking tickets, it can be a signal that something's wrong.

# Case Study: Data Analysis

![img-center-90](images/forsyth_before.png)

.caption[Screenshot from [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7181889,-73.9929608,3a,37.5y,246.59h,71.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssfMgEIL99frCBXgzXLm7PQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)]

???

The Analysis: First, Ben Wellington looked at NYPD's Parking Ticket data, available on New York City's Open Data Portal. He quickly identified outliers. Outliers are numbers in the data that don't make sense; they might be very high or very low. In this case he found that two spots in front of fire hydrants generated a combined total of $55,000 in parking tickets for one year.

Next, Wellington found the location of each of the fire hydrants from a field in the open data set, and matched it to an image in Google Street View. He saw that both these spots were set a few feet away from the curb. In fact, the car in this Google Street image had a parking ticket! Maybe drivers mistakenly thought it was legal to park there?

---

# Case Study: Solution

![img-center-90](images/parking_after.png).caption[Screenshot from [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7181889,-73.9929608,3a,37.5y,246.59h,71.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssfMgEIL99frCBXgzXLm7PQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)]

???

The Solution:
Ben published his findings to his website and New Yorkers took note. Soon after, the Department of Transportation painted stripes over those spots, so drivers could easily identify them as no-parking zones. Would the DOT have known these spots needed clear signage if NYPD hadn't opened their parking ticket data?

# Data Analysis

>“Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

## - Carter Hewgley, Director of Analytics, [Center for Government Excellence](https://govex.jhu.edu/)

???
Whether your students are going to build apps or include data points in a research paper, students need to be able to find meaning in their data.

# 6 Phases of Data Analysis
![img-center-90](images/sixphases_1.jpg)

???

You don't have to follow this path exactly, but you do need to make time for all these steps when working with data.

# Don't Wander Blindly

???

Start with questions-- the compass. Don't blindy follow the data.
Introduce analysis as an important component to any work with data.

Famous statistician and engineer who developed sampling techniques used by US Census

# Exercise Two (15 min)

## Ask the Right Questions

+ 311 is filled with noise complaints.
+ How do we work to address them?
+ .red[What questions can you ask to better understand the problem?]


???

This is a really powerful brainstorm exercise. It gives students a chance to think independently, test out ideas with a partner, then develop consensus as a group. The time constraints help students overcome self-doubt and force them to be creative.
We use it with city employees-- I think it'll translate to students, since students all had the experience of applying to middle or high school.

# Using Data to Fight Fires

???

First try-- asked the wrong questions, collected the wrong data, and the Bronx burned.  Second try-- data analysis is iterative, human and requires openess.

# Data Collection

![img-center-80](images/census_tees.jpeg)

???
The Census is a great example for exploring bias and authorship in data collection. We have a complicated history with
race and racism and it shows as we collect data about our citizens every ten years.

Q: Who conducts the Census?
A: Dept of Commerce
Q: Why do you think the Census is under the purview of the Dept of Commerce? How might their oversight influence what questions are asked or what data is collected?
Draft versions of the 2020 Census included questions about sexuality, but those have been removed:

# Exploratory Data Analysis

# Finding Context

## What can you tell about noise in New York City? What can you not tell?

???

Context -- different data points paint the full picture.
It helps to talk to a subject matter expert to get the full picture.
Consider metadata too, ie the timestamp on the photo.
