# Case Study: NYC Parking Tickets

???

The Problem: Parking enforcement can be an important source of revenue for city budgets, but
when one fire hydrant generates an annual $25,000 in parking tickets, it can be a signal that something's wrong.

# Case Study: Data Analysis

![img-center-90](images/forsyth_before.png)

.caption[Screenshot from [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7181889,-73.9929608,3a,37.5y,246.59h,71.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssfMgEIL99frCBXgzXLm7PQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)]

???

The Analysis: First, Ben Wellington looked at NYPD's Parking Ticket data, available on New York City's Open Data Portal. He quickly identified outliers. Outliers are numbers in the data that don't make sense; they might be very high or very low. In this case he found that two spots in front of fire hydrants generated a combined total of $55,000 in parking tickets for one year.

Next, Wellington found the location of each of the fire hydrants from a field in the open data set, and matched it to an image in Google Street View. He saw that both these spots were set a few feet away from the curb. In fact, the car in this Google Street image had a parking ticket! Maybe drivers mistakenly thought it was legal to park there?

# Case Study: Solution

![img-center-90](images/forsyth_after.png).caption[Screenshot from [Google Street View](https://www.google.com/maps/@40.7181889,-73.9929608,3a,37.5y,246.59h,71.81t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1ssfMgEIL99frCBXgzXLm7PQ!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)]

???

The Solution:
Ben published his findings to his website and New Yorkers took note. Soon after, the Department of Transportation painted stripes over those spots, so drivers could easily identify them as no-parking zones. Would the DOT have known these spots needed clear signage if NYPD hadn't opened their parking ticket data?

# Data Analysis

>“Analysis is simply the pursuit of understanding, usually through detailed inspection or comparison”

## - Carter Hewgley, Director of Analytics, [Center for Government Excellence](https://govex.jhu.edu/)

???
Whether your students are going to build apps or include data points in a research paper, students need to be able to find meaning in their data.

# Exercise Two (15 min)

## Pre-K For All

+ In 2013 there were ~104,000 4-yr olds in NYC but only 58,528 seats
+ Our goal: Increase enrollment by 30,000 next year and 20,000 the year after
+ But how? Consider: capacity, outreach, enrollment, and impact

First try-- asked the wrong questions, collected the wrong data, and the Bronx burned.  Second try-- data analysis is iterative, human and requires openess.

# Data Collection

???
The Census is a great example for exploring bias and authorship in data collection. We have a complicated history with
race and racism and it shows as we collect data about our citizens every ten years.

Q: Who conducts the Census?
A: Dept of Commerce
Q: Why do you think the Census is under the purview of the Dept of Commerce? How might their oversight influence what questions are asked or what data is collected?
Draft versions of the 2020 Census included questions about sexuality, but those have been removed:
